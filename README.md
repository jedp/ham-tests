## Ham Radio license exam quiz generator

I'm styding for my General class exam and made this to help.

The questions are taken verbatim from http://www.arrl.org/question-pools.

The `test.py` script parses these files an presents you with quizzes. You can
choose to be quizzed on a given subelement or on the entire question pool.

Questions are chosen at random, but the likelihood that a question will be
selected increases if you answer incorrectly. As you answer the same question
correctly, the likelihood that it will be chosen returns to normal.
